[Cloud Native Barcelona](http://cloudnative.barcelona) is the official [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) user group dedicated to building a **strong, open, diverse developer community** around the **Cloud Native** platform and technologies in **Barcelona**.

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to **build and run scalable applications** in modern, dynamic environments such as **public, private, and hybrid clouds**. **Containers**, **service meshes**, **microservices**, **immutable infrastructure**, and **declarative APIs** exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable **loosely coupled systems** that are **resilient, manageable, and observable**. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

All the **communitcation channels and events** of the [Cloud Native Barcelona](http://cloudnative.barcelona) user group are **governed by** the [Linux Foundation Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/code-of-conduct/). We are committed to making participation in this group a **harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Feel free to join us at the slack at [slack.cloudnative.barcelona](https://slack.cloudnative.barcelona).

Want to **support** [Cloud Native Barcelona](http://cloudnative.barcelona)? Do you have a **talk proposal**? Please send us details at [speak.cloudnative.barcelona](https://speak.cloudnative.barcelona), **thanks!**
