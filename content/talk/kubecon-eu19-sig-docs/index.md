summary: |
  KubeCon EU'19 session about SIG-Docs at Kubernetes.
abstract: |
  This session covers Kubernetes (K8s) documentation. We'll do an overview of the docs--how they're organized, and how they're maintained--then contribute to the docs ourselves. During the introduction, we'll look at the docs repository (kubernetes/website) and how we organize content.

  We'll also look at the website stack: how we preview and publish docs to kubernetes.io. We'll talk about the docs workflow: how SIG Docs does the work to review and publish docs. During the deep dive, we'll explore the docs contributor guide and do some hands-on contribution. Remember that contributing to docs is a pathway to Kubernetes membership!
