Since the addition of **multilingual support** for the Kubernetes website in November (https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/11/08/kubernetes-docs-updates-international-edition/), the support from the community has been amazing and currently **10 localisation teams** are working to make the documentation more accessible by **breaking the language barrier**.

**Doesn't matter if you are an expert user or just started playing with Kubernetes**, you can add new documentation from your own experience or based on the English knowledge base, review existing documentation or just fix typos, **any contribution would be appreciated!**
