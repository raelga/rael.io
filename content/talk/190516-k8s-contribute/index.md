title: "Contributing to Kubernetes"
event: Cloud Native Barcelona
event_url: https://www.meetup.com/Cloud-Native-Barcelona/events/260769421/
location: CAPSiDE HQ, Barcelona
summary: |
  Are you interested in learning how to contribute to Kubernetes? Do you want to become part of a localization team?
abstract: |
  Since the addition of multilingual support for the Kubernetes website in November (https://kubernetes.io/blog/2018/11/08/kubernetes-docs-updates-international-edition/), the support from the community has been amazing and currently 10 localisation teams are working to make the documentation more accessible by breaking the language barrier.

  Doesn't matter if you are an expert user or just started playing with Kubernetes, you can add new documentation from your own experience or based on the English knowledge base, review existing documentation or just fix typos, any contribution would be appreciated!
